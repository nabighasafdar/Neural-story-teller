# Neural-story-teller
A multimodal deep learning system that generates natural language descriptions for images using a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture. Built with PyTorch, the model utilizes a pre-trained ResNet50 encoder for visual feature extraction and an LSTM/GRU decoder for sequential text generation on the Flickr30k dataset.
